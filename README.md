### Description (#description)

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and other information pertaining to the project the README is for.

### Where i started (#started)

I looked at another example of classwork where I made a html file using node.js and using the command node index.js to run it. I then changed the html file type to an Readme.
